about me
Hi I'm Layla, I'm from London, my school is Hammersmith. I enjoy playing piano, acting and writing. I am doing mission to mars to help me improve my coding ability and learn more about programming hardware as I'd like to program some for my computer science project. I'd like to go on to do comp sci at uni.
